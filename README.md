# Color palette evaluator

Design tool for web developers to evaluate current color palettes and recommends color palettes for red and blue colorblindness.

The evaluation is based on the WCAG contrast ratio requirement.

To run add a 'color.txt' file to the same directory as the program.
In this file put your color palette in RGB format with a space between the values and each color on a separate line.

Ex:

95 148 211  
81 192 138  
228 87 46
